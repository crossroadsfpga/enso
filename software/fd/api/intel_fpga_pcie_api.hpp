/**
 * Intel FPGA PCIe device handle class.
 *
 * This class provides a handle to access an Intel FPGA PCIe device from
 * the user-space without worrying about kernel interface.
 *
 * Successful construction of an object of this class indicates that
 * the handle is properly attached to a device; when no valid device
 * is found in the system, the construction will fail.
 *
 * Two types of access patterns are supported:
 *     -# Single BAR access - manually select BAR each time before accessing
 *        a different BAR using sel_bar().
 *     -# Frequently changing the accessed BAR - use command structure
 *        (use_cmd()) and pass in desired BAR each access.
 *
 * Four methods of accesses are provided:
 *     -# read8(void *, uint8_t *), write8(void *, uint8_t), and similar
 *        functions provide up to 8B access to a previously-selected BAR.
 *     -# read(void *, size_t, void *) and write(void *, size_t, void *)
 *        provide access to a previously-selected BAR without any size
 *        restrictions.
 *     -# read8(int8_t, void *, uint8_t *), write8(int8_t, void *, uint8_t),
 *        and similar functions provide up to 8B access to any BAR.
 *     -# read(int8_t, void *, size_t, void *) and
 *        write(int8_t, void *, size_t, void *) provide access to any BAR
 *        without any size restrictions.
 * For now, the different access methods cannot be interchanged without
 * explicit toggling of use_cmd().
